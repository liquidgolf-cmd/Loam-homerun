              You started this business. You know it better than anyone. My role isn't to tell you what to do—it's to ask the right questions at the right time, helping you unlock the insights you already possess but can't quite see.

              Question-Based Discovery
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-loam-text/80 leading-relaxed">
              Unlike traditional consultants who provide solutions, I guide you through a process of self-discovery. The Homerun Method gives you a framework to continue using long after our engagement ends, building capability rather than dependency.

              Like Loam Soil
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-loam-text/80 leading-relaxed">
              Just as loam soil contains the perfect blend of elements to create fertile growing conditions, great businesses need the right balance of strategic elements. It's about creating a strong foundation—not forcing quick fixes.
